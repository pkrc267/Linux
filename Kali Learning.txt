Just started with the Kali linux network scanning cookbook.
Making a lab with metasploitable2 and Kali Linux virtual machines. Hosted on windows 10.
Installed PuTTY for ssh in the windows.
installed openssh-server in both the vms.
Set the kali linux VM network setting from NAT to Bridge network on the wifi device.
Now finally able to connect to the KALI VM via SSH in PuTTy using the ip-address of the target machine.
Putty is working with ssh and connection has been established.
* putty suddenly hanged.
* restarted putty but not able to login.
* putty says:- PuTTY Fatal Error. Netwrok Error: No route to host.
-restarting kali vm using "init 6" to again try for ssh connection
-problem solved.
- don't leave ssh as it is when not using it. always terminate the process using "exit" command, so that next time it doesn't give any error.
connecting to kali vm via putty ssh.
connection established.
running ssh.
downloading nessus. got the key in the mail.
nessus installed.
accessing it using windows system in chrome browser via https://<kali vm ip address>:8834
nessus downloaded and loading.
nessus userid: root password: toor
nessus accessible.

now moving on to BURPSUIT.
opening the burpsuit in the default configuration.
feeded the proxy address 127.0.0.1 and port as 8080.
then configuring the web browser to use manual proxy for all protocols. the manual proxy 127.0.0.1 port 8080.
now all the requested sites will be relayed through the burpsuit and nothing will be rendered on the browser.
exiting the web browser.
shutting the system now.
this marks the end of hands-on practice for chapter 1 of the Kali Linux Network Scanning Cookbook.
